# Todo CLI Application

A simple command-line interface (CLI) todo application with in-memory storage, built with Python.

## Features

### Basic Features
- Interactive menu-driven interface with numbered options (1-6 + 0 to exit)
- Add new tasks with titles and optional descriptions
- View all tasks with their ID, title, description, and completion status
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Update existing tasks' titles and descriptions
- Delete tasks by ID

### Intermediate Features (New!)
- **Priority Levels**: Assign high, medium, or low priority to tasks
- **Tags**: Add tags to tasks for categorization and easy searching
- **Search**: Search tasks by keyword across title, description, and tags (case-insensitive)
- **Filter**: Filter tasks by completion status, priority, and due date
- **Sort**: Sort tasks by title, priority, or due date (earliest first)
- **Due Dates**: Set due date for tasks for better organization

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- UV package manager (recommended)

## Setup with UV Virtual Environment

### 1. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment using UV
uv venv

# Or specify Python version explicitly
uv venv --python 3.13
```

### 2. Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
# On Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Project Dependencies
```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```bash
# Direct run
python src/cli/main.py

# With UV
uv run python src/cli/main.py

# Or run the installed script
uv run todo
```

### Interactive Menu Options:
```
======= TODO APPLICATION =======
           MAIN MENU
================================
1. Add Task
2. View All Tasks
3. Mark Task Complete
4. Mark Task Incomplete
5. Update Task
6. Delete Task
7. Search Tasks
8. Filter Tasks
9. Sort Tasks
0. Exit
================================
```

## Running with UV (Alternative Methods)

### Method 1: Direct UV Run
```bash
# Run directly without installing
uv run --with setuptools python src/cli/main.py
```

### Method 2: Install and Run
```bash
# Install project in virtual environment
uv pip install -e .

# Run the installed command
uv run todo
```

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- `models/task.py`: Contains the Task data model with support for priority, tags, and due dates
- `services/task_manager.py`: Contains business logic, in-memory storage, and advanced operations (search, filter, sort)
- `cli/main.py`: Contains the interactive command-line interface with support for all features

## Testing

To run the unit tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/unit/
```

To run the integration tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/integration/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Virtual Environment Issues
- If you get VIRTUAL_ENV warnings, make sure you've activated the environment:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

### UV Run Issues
- If `uv run` gives import errors, try:
  ```bash
  uv run --with setuptools --with uv pip install -e .
  ```

## Limitations

- Data is stored only in memory and will be lost when the application exits
- No persistent storage
- Single-user application
